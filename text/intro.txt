You've come out to a cosy little village in the country, expecting
to have a nice relaxing weekend. You're about to find out that
these villagers aren't nice to outsiders.

You can walk in four directions:
North (n)
South (s)
East (e)
West (w)

Here are some neighborhood rules:

1. Do NOT go near anybody's house. The neighbors are VERY suspicious and they
will call the police if they think you are trying to burgle them,
even if you're not.

2. Don't go too far down any alleyways.

3. If you find yourself on farmland, get the fuck off it. The local farmers
don't take kindly to trespassers.

Now. You are in a forest.
